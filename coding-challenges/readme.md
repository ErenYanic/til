# Coding Challenges & Algorithmic Solutions

This directory serves as the practical proving ground of my engineering journey. It contains solutions to algorithmic problems, machine learning tasks, and coding challenges from various platforms.

The goal is not just to reach the correct solution, but to apply clean code principles, understand the underlying mathematics, and sharpen problem-solving skills through consistent practice.

### Structure
Solutions are organized by platform and named systematically for easy navigation:
- **Platform Name/** (e.g., `LeetCode`, `Deep-ML`, `HackerRank`)
  - `ID_Category_Topic.ipynb`

### Disclaimer
These solutions represent my personal approach and understanding at the time of solving. They are documented here to track progress and reinforce learning concepts in AI and Software Engineering.
